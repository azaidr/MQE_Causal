<h3>About</h3>

<p>I am a doctoral candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley. I am interested in labor and development economics and I draw a lot of inspiration from the behavioral economics field.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in how poverty influences agent behaviors and choices in the labor market and in education. My current research focuses on student under performance on examinations due to the attention capture effects of poverty. </p>

<p>Previously, I spent six years teaching undergraduate economics for the University of Colorado Denver in Denver and Beijing.</p>
